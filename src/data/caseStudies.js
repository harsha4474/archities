    challenge: "The clients purchased a 15-year-old apartment that was dated and didn't reflect their modern aesthetic. The space had poor lighting, inefficient storage, and a closed layout that made rooms feel cramped. They wanted a contemporary home that maximized space while incorporating premium finishes on a defined budget.",

    solution: "We redesigned the entire apartment with an open-concept layout, removing non-structural walls to create flow between living, dining, and kitchen areas. Custom storage solutions were integrated throughout, and a sophisticated neutral palette with gold accents created a premium feel. Strategic lighting design transformed the ambiance completely.",
