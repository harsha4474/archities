    category: "Materials",
    question: "Can I choose my own materials and vendors?",

    id: 11,
    category: "Changes",
    question: "Can I make changes during the project?",
    answer: "Yes, minor changes can be accommodated during execution, though they may affect timeline and costs. We encourage finalizing all decisions during the design phase to avoid delays. Major changes are evaluated for feasibility and additional costs before implementation."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    category: "Payment",
    question: "What is your payment structure?",
    answer: "We follow a milestone-based payment structure: 30% advance to begin design, 30% upon design approval and before execution starts, 30% at mid-point of execution, and final 10% upon project completion. This ensures transparency and protects both parties throughout the project."
